<h2>About the Wheel Fitment Calculator</h2>
<p><img src="/tools/wheel.jpg" width="300" alt="Wheel Calculator" /></p>
<p>The wheel fitment calculator allows you to compare the arch and strut clearance of two different wheels.</p>
<p>The calculator also provides a comparison of the new wheel against other wheel sizes with the same arch clearance.</p>
<p>For example, you can see that a 9.5J et12 wheel has 37mm less arch clearance than an 8J et30 wheel; which is equivalent to having an 8J et-7 or 11J et31 wheel.</p>
