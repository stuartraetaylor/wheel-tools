<h2>About the Equivalent Arch Clearance Calculator</h2>
<p>The equivalent arch clearance calculator allows you to compare a specified wheel against other wheel sizes with the same arch clearance.</p>
<p>Once you have entered the whel specification into the form on the left, the calculator will display the equivalent offset of wheels in various widths.</p>
<p>For example, you can calculate that a 9.5J et12 wheel would have the same arch clearance as an 8J et-7 wheel.</p>
